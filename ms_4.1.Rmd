# What I Plan to Do with the Data

I hope to get actual Harvard campus data from Title IX; I have a meeting with them on Tuesday. I want to be able to use this data to explore the mystical phenonmenon of "The Red Zone." I want to see if Harvard has something similar. I could also ask HUPD for the Annual Security Report 2019, but instead of being broken down by the whole year, I could ask them to break it down by week. I am unsure how difficult the data will be able to obtain though, but I will be reaching out to different people to see if I can obtain it. If not, I may have to pivot my direction to national data possibly instead of Harvard specifically.
